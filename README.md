# rogkit

Personal command-line toolkit — 85+ tools built in Python, with Go binaries and a Rust experiment. Built for daily use on macOS (most tools also work on Linux).

Built and maintained by [Roger Dubar](https://github.com/rdubar).

## Highlights

A few tools you may find immediately useful:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `clu` | Claude Code token usage — daily totals, rate window, hourly breakdown (`-b` brief, `-x` extra) |
| `pw` | Cryptographically secure password generator |
| `serve` | Serve any folder over HTTP instantly |
| `json` | Pretty-print and query JSON from file or stdin |
| `dedupe` | Find duplicate files by content across a directory tree |
| `purge` | Remove `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, and other junk recursively |
| `scrape` | Extract readable text from any URL |
| `note` | Append a timestamped note to a Markdown file; `-l` to search |
| `myip` | Show all local interfaces and your external IP |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python** — 3.14+ recommended
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** — used for dependency management and running tools
- **Go** 1.21+ — only needed to build the Go binaries (`go/`)
- **Rust** stable toolchain — only needed to build the Rust tools (`rust/`)
- **Optional external tools** — some media tools require `ffmpeg`, `HandBrake`, or `plexapi`

---

## Installation

### Quick try (no clone required)

```sh
uvx --from git+https://github.com/rdubar/rogkit rogkit --help
```

Good for a fast smoke test on a new machine.

### Install the top-level command

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/rdubar/rogkit
rogkit --help
rogkit --credits
```

This installs the packaged `rogkit` command. It is the easiest way for a colleague
to try the toolkit on macOS or Linux without cloning the repo first.

### Full checkout (recommended for contributors and the short aliases)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rdubar/rogkit
cd rogkit
uv sync --all-extras   # install all dependencies
source "$(pwd)/aliases"  # load shell aliases into your current shell
rogkit --help          # top-level help and command overview
rogkit setup           # preview config/profile changes
rogkit setup --apply   # or: setup -y
rogkit doctor          # health check
rogkit --credits       # version, author, license, repo
rogkit --update        # run the system/package updater
```

`rogkit` is now UV-first: use `uv sync`, `uv run`, and `uv tool`, and treat the
project `.venv` as an implementation detail rather than something you activate manually.

The `aliases` file auto-detects its own repo location, so it can be sourced from
any clone path rather than assuming `~/dev/rogkit`.

For a full contributor setup, let `rogkit setup --apply` add the aliases source line
to your shell profile for future sessions.

Once aliases are loaded, run `rogkit doctor` for a quick health check covering
config, secrets, shell setup, common binaries, and media connectivity.
`rogkit doctor` includes remediation hints for common warnings and failures, and
`rogkit setup` previews by default before making any changes. Short aliases such
as `doctor`, `setup`, and `update` still work if you prefer them.

Command naming convention:
Short user-facing commands live in `aliases` (`json`, `csv`, `env`) while the
underlying Python modules may use disambiguated names such as `jsonr.py` and
`csvr.py` to avoid collisions with standard-library modules or common utilities.

## Go tools

Six compiled Go binaries live in `go/bin/` and are built with `./scripts/build_go.sh`.

| Binary | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `finder` | Canonical filesystem search — honours `.gitignore`, supports hidden files, include/exclude extensions, smart casing |

| `replacer` | Fast in-place text replacement across a file tree, with confirmation |
| `search` | Multi-term content search with batching |
| `ishtime` | Time zone conversion and "is it time?" helper |

Build all: `./scripts/build_go.sh`

Usage examples:

```sh
finder "todo" --root ~/code          # recursive content search
replacer --find TODO --replace DONE --write --confirm --path ./project
search --path ./project "TODO" "FIXME" --limit 10
ishtime --time 1530                  # convert hhmm to readable delta
```

---

## Rust

A Rust workspace lives in `rust/`. Currently contains `filehash` — a fast file hashing utility.

Build: `cargo build --release` from `rust/`.

---

## Media subsystem

`rogkit_package/media/` is a self-contained subsystem for managing a personal media library:

- **Daemon** (`daemon.py`) — background process that handles media requests asynchronously, keeping response times fast
- **Cache** (`media_cache.py`) — local SQLite + pickle cache to avoid repeated API calls
- **TMDB integration** (`tmdb.py`) — movie/TV metadata from The Movie Database
- **Plex integration** — via `plexapi` for library sync and queries
- **Search** (`search.py`) — unified search across local library and remote sources
- **Streamlit UI** (`pages/`) — web interface for browsing and managing the library

Invoked as `p` (the main alias).

Typical workflow:

```sh
p --update            # pull fresh Plex snapshot, merge extras
tmdb --csv your_media.csv   # rebuild TMDB metadata from a CSV export
p "blade runner"      # instant cache-backed search
p "blade runner" -z   # all matches, sorted by year
p --stats             # aggregate totals
```

If the daemon gets into a bad state:

```sh
p -S    # stop daemon
p       # next run restarts it automatically
```

---

## Architecture

```
User shell → alias
           → rogkit_py() wrapper  (sets ROGKIT_CWD="$PWD")
           → uv run --directory "$ROGKIT" python -m rogkit_package.bin.<tool>
           → tool.main()
```

Tools use `from ..settings import get_invoking_cwd` to recover the user's original working directory, since `uv run --directory` changes cwd to the rogkit root.

Configuration lives in two files:

**`~/.config/rogkit/config.toml`** — non-sensitive settings (safe to version-control):

```toml
[plex]
plex_server_url = "http://192.168.1.100"

[vido]
download_folder = "~/Downloads/Videos"

[backup]
secret_patterns = ["secrets.toml", ".env"]

[[backup.set]]
name = "CloudBackup"
destinations = ["~/Dropbox/Backups"]
paths = ["~/.config/", "~/dev"]

[[backup.set]]
name = "LocalBackup"
include_secrets = true
destinations = ["~/Archive/Backups"]
paths = ["~/.config/", "~/dev", "~/.env"]
```

**`~/.config/rogkit/secrets.toml`** — credentials only (gitignored, excluded from cloud backups):

```toml
[plex]
plex_server_token = "your_token"

[tmdb]
tmdb_api_key = "your_key"

[spotify]
spotify_client_id = "..."
spotify_client_secret = "..."
```

Both files share the same TOML structure. `secrets.toml` is deep-merged on top of `config.toml` at load time — tools see a single unified config with no code changes required. See [`rogkit_sample.toml`](rogkit_sample.toml) for a full annotated example.

## Python import examples

All tools are importable as regular Python modules:

```python
from rogkit_package.bin.bytes import byte_size
print(byte_size(1_234_567_890))         # "1.23 GB"
print(byte_size(1_234_567_890, base=1024))  # "1.15 GiB"

from rogkit_package.bin.bignum import bignum
print(bignum(1e12))                     # "1 trillion (e+12)"

from rogkit_package.bin.seconds import convert_seconds
print(convert_seconds(3665))            # "1 hour and 1 minute"

from rogkit_package.bin.plural import plural
print(plural("person"))                 # "people"
print(plural("cat", 1))                # "cat"

from rogkit_package.bin.strike import strikethru
print(strikethru("obsolete"))          # "o̶b̶s̶o̶l̶e̶t̶e̶"

from rogkit_package.bin.pw import PasswordGenerator
pg = PasswordGenerator(length=20)
print(pg.generate_and_store_password())
```

## Development

```sh
make dev              # uv sync --all-extras
make test             # uv run pytest -q
make lint             # uv run ruff check .
./scripts/build_go.sh # compile all Go binaries
```

Commit style: `tool_name: what changed` (e.g. `clean: add -t/--total option`). One logical change per commit, directly to `main`.

---

## Streamlit web interface

A lightweight web UI is available for browsing the media library and a few interactive tools:

```sh
uv run streamlit run Home.py
```

Available pages: Media library browser, password generator, random-case converter.

---

## Platform support

Primarily developed and tested on **macOS**. Most tools work on Linux. A small number of tools (`cleaner`, `system`, `myip`) have macOS-specific behaviour but degrade gracefully on other platforms.

The top-level `rogkit` command works on both macOS and Linux. `rogkit update`
currently supports macOS plus `apt`-based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu,
Raspberry Pi OS).
